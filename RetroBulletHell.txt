CMPUT 275 Project Proposal: Retro Arcade Bullet Hell by Arseniy Kouzmenkov and
Patrisha de Boon

Description:
The project is planned to be a typical arcade style retro bullet hell game built
completely in Python3 using pygame. There will be multiple different enemies
that will be generated in random waves. The enemies will be shooting different
projectiles at the player. The game will get more and more difficult as the game
progresses. The player will be awarded points for destroying enemies and a
highest score will be displayed at the end of each game. Before the game starts,
the player will be able to change difficulty which will change the amount of
hitpoints that the enemies have. This project will have to use data structures
discussed in class for efficient lookup time, and the code will implement typical
object oriented programming paradigms. In addition to that, we will write the
random generation algorithm for the enemies. As a result, this project will
demonstrate all the relevant knowledge from the CMPUT 275 material.

Milestones:

1) March 22:
Get the basic gameplay mechanics: one type of enemies is generated and comes
down the screen in waves, the player moves on the screen. The enemies are stored
in correct data structures.

2) March 27:
Create multiple types of enemies, make the enemies fire different projectiles,
make the player shoot different projectiles, randomise the enemy generation.

3) April 3:
Create collision detection, create the game over state, create the menu, create
a "nuke" that will clear the screen. Create a speed increment of the game as the
game progresses.

4) April 8:
Create alterable difficulty settings in the menu, do graphical touch ups,
implement the score tracking and high score mechanics. Final touch ups before
presentation.
